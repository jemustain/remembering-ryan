Once upon a time, Julie, the best friend of Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, opened her screen door to let her dog Ryu and her two cats, one orange and one black and white, play outside. But oh no! The screen door had a big rip! "The bugs will get in!" Julie said, worried.

Ryan came over with his dog Balto and saw the torn screen. "Don't worry, Julie!" he said with a big smile. "I know how to fix this!" He told Julie they needed to go to the hardware store for supplies. So, they hopped into Ryan's big green truck with Balto and Ryu wagging their tails in the back.

At the hardware store, Ryan picked out a new screen and some special tools.

 "This will make the door good as new!" he said. Julie helped carry a shiny screwdriver, and they loaded everything into the truck. Balto sniffed the bags, and Ryu tilted his head, curious about the adventure.

Back at Julie's house, Ryan got to work. He took off the old, ripped screen and measured the new one carefully. "One, two, three feet!" he counted. He cut the screen with a snip-snip and fastened it to the door with his tools. Julie watched, amazed, as Ryan worked super fast, like a superhero fixing things.

In no time, the screen door was fixed! Julie opened and closed it, and it worked perfectly. "No more bugs!" she cheered, clapping her hands. The cats meowed happily, and Ryu and Balto ran through the yard, chasing a butterfly. "You're the best, Ryan!" Julie said, giving him a big high-five.

Ryan and Julie sat on the porch, petting their animals, who were all happy with the new screen door. The house felt cozy and safe, and their hearts were warm, knowing they could fix anything together.

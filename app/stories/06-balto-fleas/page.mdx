# Balto Fleas

<HeroImage src="/images/stories/06-balto-fleas/dog-bath.jpg" alt="Giving a dog a bath" />


Once upon a time, Ryan noticed something unusual about his beloved dog Balto. Instead of his usual happy, bouncy self, Balto was scratching and itching all the time! He would scratch behind his ears, scratch his belly, and scratch his back legs - scratch, scratch, scratch!

Ryan knelt down to look more closely at his furry friend. As he gently parted Balto's soft fur, he saw tiny little creatures hopping around like miniature jumping beans. "Oh no, Balto!" Ryan said with concern in his voice. "You have fleas! We need to fix this right away so you can feel comfortable and happy again!"

Ryan immediately picked up his phone and called his friend Julie, because he knew she loved animals just as much as he did.

"Hi Julie, I need some help," Ryan said. "Balto has fleas, and I'm going to take him to the vet right away. Can you help us through this?"

Julie's caring voice came through the phone right away. "Of course I'll help! Poor Balto! Ryu and my cats will be sending him lots of good thoughts and healing wishes!" she said warmly.

Ryan gently lifted Balto into his big green F350 truck and they drove off to see the animal doctor.

The veterinarian's office was a place full of people who loved helping animals feel better. A kind doctor with gentle hands and a warm smile examined Balto carefully.

"Don't worry at all," the vet said reassuringly. "Fleas are very common, and we know exactly how to make them go away! We'll give Balto some medicine that will make the fleas disappear."

She gave Balto a small pill that would work from the inside to make the fleas go away. Balto was such a brave dog - he wagged his tail and took his medicine like a champion!

The doctor explained everything to Ryan: "Balto will need lots of baths to wash away the fleas, and he should stay away from other animals for just a little while so the fleas don't spread to his friends. But don't worry - he'll be feeling much better very soon!"

Back home, Ryan decided to turn bath time into the most fun game ever! He filled a big tub with warm, comfortable water and added bubbly soap that smelled like fresh flowers.

"Are you ready for the best bath ever, Balto?" Ryan asked with excitement.

*Splash!* Balto jumped right into the tub, sending water flying everywhere and getting Ryan completely soaked! But Ryan just laughed and started scrubbing Balto's fur very gently while singing a silly song:

*"Scrub, scrub, bye-bye fleas!  
Balto's fur will be clean as can be!  
Splash, splash, bubbles everywhere,  
Soon you'll have the shiniest hair!"*

Balto barked happily - "Woof, woof!" - and shook water all over Ryan, making them both look like they had taken the bath together!

Julie came over to help, but she was very careful to keep Ryu and her cats safely inside the house so that Balto could get better without spreading the fleas to his friends.

She stood at the window, waving enthusiastically and calling out, "Get better soon, Balto! We're all rooting for you!"

The orange cat and the black-and-white cat pressed their little faces against the window and meowed their encouragement - "Meow, meow!" - which meant "We love you, Balto!"

Ryu wagged his tail from inside the house, sending all his doggy love and friendship to help Balto feel better.

After several days of fun bubble baths and taking his medicine like a good dog, something wonderful happened - Balto's itching completely stopped! His fur became shiny and soft and beautiful again.

Ryan checked Balto's fur very carefully, looking through every inch. "No more fleas!" he cheered, throwing his hands up in celebration.

Balto was so excited and happy to feel good again that he ran in joyful circles around the yard, his tail wagging like a furry flag of victory!

Ryan knew it was time to celebrate, so he brought Balto to Julie's house for a reunion party. At first, Ryu and the cats stayed at a safe distance, just to make sure everything was okay. But soon, when they could see that Balto was healthy and flea-free, they all started playing together in the yard like the best of friends.

Balto and Ryu chased each other around in happy circles, playing tag and rolling in the soft grass. The cats watched from their favorite sunny spots, purring contentedly like little motors of happiness.

Ryan and Julie sat together on the porch, laughing as they watched their furry friends play. It was such a wonderful sight to see everyone healthy and happy again.

"You're such a good dog helper, Ryan," Julie said with admiration. "Balto is so lucky to have someone who cares about him so much."

Ryan smiled warmly while petting Balto's now-shiny fur. "And you're the most wonderful friend for helping us through this!" he replied.

Their hearts felt warm and cozy, knowing that Balto was completely healthy and happy again. They had worked together as a team to solve the problem, and now all their furry friends could play together safely once more.

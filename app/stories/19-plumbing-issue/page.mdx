# Plumbing Issue

## The Leaky Valve

Once upon a time, Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, was at Julie's house, ready to fix a leaky valve in her bathroom. Julie's dog Ryu and her two cats, one orange and one black and white, were playing nearby, while Ryan's dog Balto napped in the sun. Ryan said, "I'll fix this valve so the bathroom works perfectly!" Julie smiled, "You're the best, Ryan!"

## Missing a Part

Ryan grabbed his toolbox and drove his big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant, to Julie's house. He turned off the water so he could work safely. "This will be quick!" he said, starting to take apart the old valve. But oh no! When he looked in his toolbox, he was missing a special part he needed to finish the job.

Ryan asked, "Julie, what time is it?" Julie checked her clock. "It's just after the hardware store closed!" she said. They looked at each other and giggled. "No water tonight!" Ryan said, laughing. Julie laughed too. "It's okay, we'll have an adventure!"

## Camping Adventure

That night, they couldn't wash dishes or take showers, but they made it fun. They used paper plates for dinner and played a silly game with Ryu and Balto, pretending they were camping. The cats curled up on the couch, purring, as if they were in on the fun. Ryan and Julie told funny stories by the wood stove, giggling until bedtime.

## All Fixed!

The next morning, Ryan woke up early and drove to the hardware store as soon as it opened. He got the perfect part for the valve and zoomed back to Julie's house. With a twist and a turn, he fixed the valve super fast. "All done!" he cheered, turning the water back on. The faucet worked perfectly, with no more leaks.

Julie clapped and gave Ryan a big hug. "You're my hero!" she said. Ryu barked, Balto wagged his tail, and the cats meowed, happy the house was fixed. Ryan and Julie sat on the porch, petting their animals, laughing about their no-water night. Their hearts were warm, knowing every little mishap was just another fun story to share.

# Bathroom Repairs

## A Big Mess

Once upon a time, Julie, the best friend of Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, noticed a big problem in her bathroom. The walls were wet, the shower looked broken, and the toilet was wobbly from water damage! "Oh no!" Julie said, looking at the mess. Her dog Ryu and her two cats, one orange and one black and white, tilted their heads, confused.

Ryan came over with his dog Balto and said, "Don't worry, Julie! I know just what to do!" He checked the bathroom and saw a leaky valve that caused all the trouble. "We need to fix the valve, the walls, the shower, and the toilet!" he said. But first, he had to turn off the water to start the work.

## Another No-Water Night

Ryan got his tools from his big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant, and began fixing the valve. But oh no! He realized he was missing a special part to finish the job. "Julie, what time is it?" he asked. Julie looked at the clock. "It's just after the hardware store closed!" she said. They both laughed. "Looks like we'll have no water tonight!"

Julie and Ryan made it fun, like a camping adventure. They used bottled water to brush their teeth and told silly stories by the wood stove, with Balto, Ryu, and the cats curled up nearby. The cats purred, and the dogs wagged their tails, happy to be with their favorite people.

## Ryan the Superhero

The next morning, Ryan zoomed to the hardware store as soon as it opened, with Balto in the truck. He got the missing part and rushed back to Julie's house. He fixed the valve with a twist and a turn, then worked like a superhero to repair the bathroom. He patched the drywall, making the walls smooth and strong. He fixed the shower so it sparkled like new. Then he set the toilet back in place, sturdy and steady.

## Perfect Again

Julie clapped when Ryan was done. "You're so great, Ryan!" she cheered. The bathroom looked perfect! Ryu ran in, sniffing the clean floor, and the cats jumped on the counter, meowing happily. Ryan and Julie high-fived, laughing about their waterless night.

They sat on the porch, petting their animals, feeling happy and proud. The house was fixed, and their hearts were full, knowing they could turn any mishap into a fun adventure together.

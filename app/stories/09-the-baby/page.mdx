Once upon a time, it was the day after Christmas, and Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, and his best friend Julie were snuggled up at Julie's house, sipping hot cocoa by the cozy wood stove.

Julie had a big, happy surprise. She held Ryan's hand and said, "Ryan, I'm going to have a baby!" Ryan's eyes sparkled, and he jumped up, shouting, "We're having a baby!" He was so, so excited, like when you get a big Christmas present. Julie and Ryan had always wanted a kid to love, but they didn't expect one so soon.

 That made it extra special!

Even better, Ryan's sister Chrissy and Julie's sister Monica were going to have babies, too, all around the same time! Three new babies in the family! Everyone was so excited, like a big party full of love.

Ryan and Julie sat by the warm stove and talked for hours and hours. "Will our baby be a boy or a girl?" Julie asked, smiling. Ryan grinned. "Maybe a boy named Ryan, like me, or a girl named Monica, like your sister!" They giggled, thinking about names for their baby. "We could also name them Aiden or William," Julie said. Ryan nodded, "Those are perfect!"

They dreamed about teaching their baby at home, with stories, games, and adventures. "We'll show them stars, animals, and how to build things!" Ryan said. Julie clapped, imagining their happy family and the three new cousins playing together.

The next day, Ryan and Julie went to the doctor to check on the baby. Ryan drove his big green truck, an F350. The doctor smiled and said, "Your baby is happy and healthy!" Julie and Ryan hugged each other, so thrilled.

Back home, they called Chrissy and Monica to share the good news. "Our babies will be best friends!" Chrissy said. Monica laughed, "Three cousins, all born so close together!" Balto barked, Ryu wagged his tail, and the cats purred even louder, as if they knew it was a special day.

Ryan and Julie held hands, their hearts as big as the moon. They couldn't wait to meet their baby and see the new cousins, Ryan, Monica, or maybe Aiden or William, all growing up together in a family full of love.

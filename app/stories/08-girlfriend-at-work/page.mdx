# Girlfriend at Work

## Ryan Needs Extra Help

Once upon a time, Ryan was looking at his work schedule for the day and realized he had a very big problem. He had lots and lots of important customer jobs to finish - like fixing a wobbly porch that needed to be safe and strong, and building a tall fence to keep a family's yard secure and pretty.

But when Ryan called his workers to see who could help, only one person could come that day - his employee Tom, who was a good helper but just one person for so many big jobs!

Ryan scratched his head and thought hard. "I really need more help today!" he said to himself. Then, like a lightbulb turning on in his brain, he had the most wonderful idea.

"Julie!" he called excitedly. "Would you like to come with me to work today? I could really use an extra pair of hands, and you could meet my customers!"

## Julie Joins the Team

Julie's face lit up with excitement when Ryan asked her. She clapped her hands together and said, "Yes! I would absolutely love to help you and meet the people you work for!"

Julie had always been curious about Ryan's building work, and she thought it would be so much fun to see him in action, being the amazing fixer and builder that he was.

So Ryan, Julie, and Tom all got ready to go on their work adventure together. Balto and Ryu decided they would rather stay home with Julie's two cats, where they could all take cozy naps in the warm sunshine streaming through the windows.

Ryan helped Julie climb up into his big green truck - his F350 as big and friendly as a gentle giant - and she sat proudly in the front passenger seat. Tom climbed into the back seat, but he wasn't quite as happy about the seating arrangement.

## A Little Seat Situation

"Hmph," Tom said, crossing his arms with a pouty expression. "I usually get to sit in the front seat when we go to jobs!"

But Ryan just laughed good-naturedly and said, "Don't worry, Tom! You're still my very best work helper, and I need you to help me make today amazing!"

Julie turned around with a sweet smile and said, "I promise I'll share all my snacks with you later, Tom! We're going to make such a great team!"

Tom's grumpy expression started to soften just a little bit when he heard about the snacks.

## The First Job Adventure

At their first job, they met Mrs. Lee, who had a porch that wobbled every time someone walked on it. It wasn't safe, and she needed Ryan's expert building skills to make it strong and sturdy again.

Ryan and Tom got to work right away, measuring and hammering and using all their special tools. Meanwhile, Julie became the most helpful assistant! She carried tools back and forth, organized screws and nails in neat little piles, and talked with Mrs. Lee about her beautiful garden.

"You're so kind and helpful!" Mrs. Lee said to Julie with a big, warm smile. "Ryan is lucky to have such a wonderful friend!"

Julie beamed with pride and happiness, feeling so good about being able to help Ryan and make the customers feel welcome and comfortable.

## Building a Fence Together

At their next job, they met a family who needed a tall, strong fence built around their backyard. They had a playful puppy who kept trying to escape and explore the neighborhood!

Ryan and Tom started measuring and cutting the wood for the fence posts, while Julie had the very important job of holding the wooden boards steady so Ryan could attach them properly.

But the best part was when the family's little puppy came running over to see what all the building noise was about! The puppy had the fluffiest fur and the most excited tail that wagged like a tiny, furry fan.

Julie knelt down and gently petted the puppy, who immediately decided she was his new best friend. The puppy rolled over to show his belly and made everyone laugh with his playful antics.

## Everyone Working Together

All day long, Julie and Ryan worked side by side, laughing and making even the hardest jobs feel like fun games. Julie learned how to hand Ryan exactly the right tools at exactly the right time, and she became an expert at talking with customers and making them feel happy and taken care of.

Tom started to smile more and more throughout the day, especially when Julie shared her delicious granola bars during their lunch break. The granola bars were crunchy and sweet and gave everyone energy to keep working hard.

All the customers they met that day kept telling Ryan, "Your team is absolutely the best! You all work so well together, and everyone is so friendly and helpful!"

## A Successful Day

When they finished all their jobs for the day, Ryan drove everyone back home in his big green truck. Julie was tired but so happy and proud of all the work they had accomplished together.

"I had the most amazing time helping you today!" Julie said with excitement still sparkling in her eyes.

Ryan reached over and gave her the biggest high-five that made a loud *smack* sound. "You're an absolutely awesome helper!" he said with the proudest smile. "My customers loved you, and you made every job better!"

Even Tom, who had been grumpy about the seating arrangement that morning, grinned and said, "You know what? The back seat wasn't so bad after all. And those granola bars were really good!"

## Happy Homecoming

When they got back home, it was like a happy reunion party! Balto, Ryu, and Julie's two cats came running and meowing and barking to greet them, as if they had been waiting by the door all day for their favorite people to come home.

Ryan and Julie sat together on the front porch, petting all their furry friends and feeling incredibly happy and proud of their successful day working together.

As the sun started to set and painted the sky in pretty pink and orange colors, they both knew they had discovered something really special - they made an amazing team, whether they were building fences, fixing porches, or just enjoying quiet moments together with their beloved pets.

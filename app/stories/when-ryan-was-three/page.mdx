# When Ryan Was Three

*A story for Ryan's son*

Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Ryan who was exactly three years old - just like you are now!

Ryan loved to play with toy trucks and build tall towers with blocks. He would make "vroom vroom" sounds as he drove his trucks around the living room, just like you do with your toys.

## Ryan's Favorite Things

When Ryan was three, his favorite things were:

- Big red trucks (just like yours!)
- Apple slices with peanut butter  
- Stories before bedtime
- Singing songs with his family
- Running around in the backyard

Ryan always gave the biggest hugs and had the silliest laugh. He would giggle when someone tickled his toes, and he loved to splash in the bathtub until the whole bathroom was wet!

## Ryan's Big Heart

Even when Ryan was very little, he had such a kind heart. If he saw someone sad, he would try to make them smile. If his toys were broken, he would share them anyway because he thought sharing was more important than having perfect things.

Ryan loved his family so much that he would draw pictures for them with his crayons - pictures of stick figures holding hands under a big yellow sun.

## Just Like You

You know what's really special? You have Ryan's beautiful smile and his curious eyes. You ask questions about everything, just like Ryan did when he was three. And when you give hugs, they're just as warm and wonderful as the hugs Ryan used to give.

Ryan would be so proud of the smart, kind little boy you're becoming. He would love to play trucks with you and read stories together.

*The End*

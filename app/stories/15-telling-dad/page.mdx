# Telling Dad

## Sharing Happy News

Once upon a time, Julie, the best friend of Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, was so excited about her baby on the way. She wanted to share the happy news with her dad and stepmom, so she planned a special trip to visit them with her sister Monica, who was also going to have a baby soon. Julie's dog Ryu and her two cats, one orange and one black and white, stayed home with Ryan and his dog Balto and four tortoises.

Julie and Monica packed their bags and flew to their dad's house far away. Ryan drove Julie to the airport in his big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant. "I'll miss you!" Julie said, giving Ryan and Balto big hugs. Ryan smiled, "I'll miss you too, but I'll take care of Ryu and the cats!" Julie waved as she walked into the airport with Monica.

## The Big Announcement

At their dad's house, Julie and Monica sat with their dad and stepmom at a cozy table full of yummy snacks like cookies and fruit. Julie said, "Guess what? I'm going to have a baby!" Monica clapped and said, "Me too!" Their dad and stepmom cheered, "Two new grandbabies!" They hugged Julie and Monica, so happy about the growing family.

Julie and Monica spent the weekend laughing and talking with their dad and stepmom. They shared stories about their favorite foods and fun times, and Julie told them all about Ryan—how he fixed her car, built a tortoise house, and was so kind. "He's the best!" Julie said, her eyes shining. But she missed Ryan, Balto, Ryu, and her cats so much.

## A Weekend Full of Love

They played games and ate warm soup, and their dad said, "Your babies will be so loved!" Julie and Monica smiled, dreaming about their babies playing together as cousins. The visit was full of love, like a big, warm hug.

When it was time to go home, Ryan and Balto picked Julie up at the airport. Julie ran to them, shouting, "I'm back!" Balto wagged his tail, and Ryan gave her a big hug. "I missed you!" he said. Julie told Ryan all about her fun trip and how excited her dad and stepmom were about the baby.

## Home Sweet Home

Back at their house, Ryu and the cats ran to greet Julie, and the tortoises wiggled in their special box. Julie and Ryan sat together, petting their animals, feeling happy and cozy. Their hearts were full, knowing their baby would have a big, loving family.

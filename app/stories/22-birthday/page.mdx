# Birthday

## Julie's Special Day

Once upon a time, it was a special day—Julie's 29th birthday! Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, wanted to make it the best day ever for his best friend Julie, who was carrying their baby. He drove his big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant, to a flower shop and picked out a big bunch of purple flowers, Julie's favorite color, like pretty violets and lavender. Their dogs, Balto and Ryu, and Julie's two cats stayed home with Ryan's four tortoises, napping in their cozy house.

Ryan gave Julie the purple flowers, and she smiled so big. "These are beautiful!" she said, giving him a big hug. Ryan said, "Happy birthday, Julie! Let's go have fun!" They hopped into the big green truck and drove to a new Thai restaurant that smelled like yummy noodles and spices.

## A Delicious Birthday Dinner

At the restaurant, Ryan and Julie sat at a table with twinkly lights. They held hands and giggled, eating tasty Thai food like spring rolls and coconut soup. "This is so yummy!" Julie said, slurping a noodle. Ryan laughed and nodded, his heart warm like the soup. They talked about their baby and the special ultrasound picture that showed their little one wiggling like a tiny dancer.

## Pokémon Under the Stars

After dinner, they played their favorite phone game, Pokémon, walking around outside the restaurant. "I caught a Jigglypuff!" Julie cheered. Ryan grinned, "I got a Charmander!" They laughed and ran, catching funny creatures under the stars.

## Home Sweet Home

Back home, they looked at the ultrasound picture again, dreaming about their baby. "Our baby will love birthdays and Pokémon, too!" Julie said. Ryan hugged her tight, saying, "This is the best birthday ever because we're together." Julie's purple flowers sat in a vase, making the house even cozier.

Balto, Ryu, the cats, and the tortoises were happy to see them, wagging tails and purring. Ryan and Julie snuggled on the couch, feeling so excited for their baby and all the happy days ahead.

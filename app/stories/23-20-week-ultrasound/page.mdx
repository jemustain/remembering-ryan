# 20 Week Ultrasound

## The Big Day

Once upon a time, Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, and his best friend Julie were counting the days until their big 20-week ultrasound. This was a special doctor visit where they'd see clear pictures of their baby growing in Julie's tummy! They were so excited, like waiting for a big surprise. Their dogs, Balto and Ryu, Julie's two cats, one orange and one black and white, and Ryan's four tortoises stayed home, napping in their cozy house.

## Almost Late!

On the day of the ultrasound, Ryan was busy fixing a fence at work and lost track of time. "Oh no!" he said, checking his watch. "I'm running late!" He jumped into his big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant, and zoomed to pick up Julie. They hurried to the doctor's office, giggling as they just made it in time.

## Seeing Their Baby

Inside, the doctor put a wand on Julie's tummy, and a picture appeared on a screen. There was their baby, wiggling like a little fish! "Look, Ryan!" Julie said, pointing at the screen. The baby's tiny hands and feet moved, and the doctor said, "Your baby is perfect and healthy!" Ryan and Julie clapped, their hearts so happy.

## Pictures to Keep Forever

The doctor gave them clear pictures of the baby to take home. Ryan held one up, saying, "Our baby looks like a tiny superhero!" Julie laughed, "Maybe they'll love Pokémon like us!" They hugged, dreaming about their baby playing with Balto, Ryu, the cats, and the tortoises.

Back home, they showed the ultrasound pictures to their animals. Balto wagged his tail, Ryu barked, the cats purred, and the tortoises peeked out of their special box. Ryan and Julie put the pictures on the fridge, smiling every time they saw them. They felt so excited, knowing their perfect baby would be with them soon.

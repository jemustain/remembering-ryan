Once upon a time, it was Easter time, and Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, and his best friend Julie were so excited about their baby on the way. They wanted to celebrate with a fun activity, so Ryan drove his big green truck to WinCo and got colorful egg-dyeing kits. Their dogs, Balto and Ryu, and Julie's two cats, one orange and one black and white, stayed home with Ryan's four tortoises, napping in the cozy house.

At Julie's house, Ryan and Julie set up a table with bowls of bright colors—red, blue, yellow, and green! They boiled eggs and dipped them in the dye, making funny patterns like swirls and stripes.

 "Look at this one!" Julie giggled, holding up a sparkly blue egg. Ryan laughed, showing off a red egg with yellow spots. "Our eggs are the best!" he said.

As they dyed eggs, Julie felt a little wiggle in her tummy. "Ryan, the baby's moving!" she said, her eyes wide. Ryan put his hand gently on her tummy and smiled big. "Wow, our baby's saying hi!" They sat by the table, surrounded by colorful eggs, and talked about their family. "Our baby will love dyeing eggs someday," Julie said, dreaming of Easter with their kid.

Julie was so excited she said, "Maybe we can have another baby right after this one! I want a big family!" Ryan chuckled and hugged her. "Let's take it one baby at a time, Julie. We'll see how you feel when this one's here." Julie nodded, giggling. "Okay, but I'm so excited!"

They imagined their baby growing up with Balto, Ryu, the cats, and the tortoises, playing and laughing. They talked about teaching their kids to dye eggs, build things, and love animals. The house felt warm and happy, like a big Easter basket full of love.

When they finished, they put the shiny eggs in a basket and shared a carrot with Balto and Ryu, who wagged their tails. The cats purred, watching from the couch, and the tortoises peeked out of their special box. Ryan and Julie held hands, feeling so happy about their baby and their future together.

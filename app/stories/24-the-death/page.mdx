# The Death

## Ryan's Brave Heart

Once upon a time, a long time ago, Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, had a big accident at work. A spark zapped him like lightning, and it hurt his heart a little. Ryan told his best friend Julie about it, but she didn't know how strong it made his heart work every day. Ryan was so brave and active—he built houses, played with Balto his dog, and fixed everything with a smile. He never seemed sick, just full of love.

## When Ryan Got Sick

One sunny Sunday, Ryan started feeling yucky, like a tummy ache that wouldn't go away. He tried to play with Julie, their dogs Balto and Ryu, Julie's two cats, and Ryan's four tortoises, but he felt tired. By Wednesday, he was really sick, so Julie helped him go to urgent care, a place where doctors check you fast.

The doctors said, "You need the big hospital!" But they tried to keep Ryan away from Julie, and Ryan wasn't happy. "I want Julie with me!" he said. He even left for a bit, but Julie held his hand and said, "Let's go to another hospital together. We're a team!" So they did, driving in Ryan's big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant.

## Fighting Together

At the new hospital, they waited a long, long time in the waiting room. Ryan was scared of pokey needles, like little bee stings for tests. Julie hugged him and said, "You're my brave hero. We'll do it together!" With Julie's help, Ryan let the doctors take a tiny blood sample to find out what was wrong.

The doctors learned Ryan had a bad germy sickness in his lungs, like a stormy cloud called pneumonia, and it made a big infection in his blood, called sepsis. Ryan's hurt heart was working so hard to fight it, like a tired knight in a big battle. The doctors gave him medicine and love, and Julie stayed by his side, whispering, "I love you forever."

## Becoming a Star

But even with all their help, Ryan's heart got too tired. He went to a peaceful place in the stars, where he could rest and watch over everyone. Julie was 22 weeks along with their baby, and her heart hurt so much, like a big rain cloud. She was sad she'd bring their baby into the world without Ryan's hugs and laughs. Balto, Ryu, the cats, and the tortoises snuggled close, purring and wagging tails to comfort her.

## Julie's Promise

In the quiet night, Julie held her tummy and talked to the baby and Ryan. "I promise," she whispered, tears like sparkly rain, "I'll love our baby with all my heart, just like you loved me. We'll build adventures, play Pokémon, and remember your big smiles. Our baby will know you're a star watching over us."

Julie's love grew stronger, like a flower after rain. She knew Ryan was proud, and their baby would bring sunshine and joy, with all the animals as their furry family. Even in sadness, love shines bright, and Julie was ready to be the best mama ever.

*Love never ends. It becomes the brightest star in the sky, watching over us always.*

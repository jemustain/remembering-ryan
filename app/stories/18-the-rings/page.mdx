# The Rings

## Pokémon and Wedding Plans

Once upon a time, Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, and his best friend Julie were so excited about their baby on the way and their plans to get married. They loved playing a fun phone game called Pokémon, where you go to different places to catch silly creatures. One day, they decided to go to a big, shiny mall to play Pokémon and look for special rings for their wedding.

Ryan drove his big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant, with Julie by his side. Their dogs, Balto and Ryu, and Julie's two cats stayed home, napping in the cozy house with Ryan's four tortoises. At the mall, Ryan and Julie walked around, holding their phones and giggling as they caught Pokémon. "I got a Pikachu!" Julie cheered. Ryan laughed, "I caught a Bulbasaur!"

## Finding the Perfect Rings

After catching lots of Pokémon, they went to a sparkly jewelry store. The store had shiny rings that twinkled like stars. Julie tried on lots of rings—some with big gems, some with little ones. She spun them on her finger, saying, "This one's so pretty!" Ryan tried on a few rings, too, but he was a little shy. "You look great!" Julie said, making him smile.

They talked about what they liked best—a shiny silver ring for Julie and a strong, simple one for Ryan. "These are perfect for us!" Julie said, clapping her hands. Ryan nodded, his heart feeling warm and happy. They picked out their favorite rings to get later for their special day.

## A Perfect Day Together

When they were done, they played more Pokémon, running around the mall and laughing as they caught more funny creatures. They even shared a big pretzel, munching happily. "This is the best day!" Julie said. Ryan agreed, "I can't wait to get married and have our baby!"

Back home, they told Balto, Ryu, the cats, and the tortoises about their fun day. The animals wagged their tails and purred, as if they were excited, too. Ryan and Julie hugged, dreaming of their wedding and their baby, knowing their life together would be full of love and adventures.

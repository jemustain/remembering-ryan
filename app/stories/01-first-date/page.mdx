# First Date

Once upon a time, there was a man named Ryan. He was tall and had blonde hair. Ryan was strong and loved to build things and fix things that were broken.

Every day, Ryan drove his big green truck to work. It was an F350, so big that when little kids saw it, they would point and say "WOW! Look at that huge truck!"

One day, Ryan was using his computer when he met a lady named Julie. They would send each other messages every day. Julie loved to tell funny stories, and Ryan loved to listen to them. They laughed together through their computers!

After talking for many days, they decided to meet at Chipotle. It's a restaurant where they make burritos with rice and beans inside.

On a sunny day, Ryan walked into Chipotle. He was a little nervous but very excited! There was Julie with a big smile. They sat down together and started talking about their favorite foods and sharing jokes.

They talked and talked and laughed so much that their cheeks hurt from smiling! They forgot all about time because they were having so much fun together.

When the Chipotle workers said "Time to close!" Ryan and Julie didn't want to stop talking. So they decided to take a walk around a lake nearby.

The lake was beautiful! There were ducks swimming around going "quack, quack!" and birds singing songs in the trees. The water sparkled when the sun touched it. Ryan and Julie walked slowly, talking about all their favorite things.

When it was time to say goodbye, Ryan looked at Julie's car and noticed something. "Oh my!" he said. "Your tire needs more air!"

Julie was worried, but Ryan smiled. "Don't worry! I love helping people, and I'm really good at fixing things!"

Ryan went to his truck and pulled out a machine called a compressor. It makes a "whoosh" sound and fills tires with air, just like blowing up a balloon! 

Ryan filled up the tire until it was round again. Then he filled all the other tires too, just to make sure they were all ready for safe driving. Julie clapped her hands. "Thank you, Ryan!"

Then Ryan noticed something else about Julie's car. There was a plug that wasn't working right - the kind that helps charge things with electricity.

"I can fix that for you another day," Ryan said. "I love fixing things and making them work again!"

Julie gave Ryan a big, warm hug. "You have a kind heart!" she said. And Ryan felt so happy and warm inside.

From that day on, Ryan and Julie became the very best of friends. They went on many more adventures together, and eventually, they loved each other so much that they decided to have a family.

*Ryan's kind heart and helpful hands are part of what made you so special too.*

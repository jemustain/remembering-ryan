# First Date

## How Ryan Met Mommy

Once upon a time, there was a very special man named Ryan. He was tall and had beautiful blonde hair that sparkled in the sunshine. Ryan was super strong and loved to build things and fix things that were broken.

Every day, Ryan drove his big, big truck to work. It was green like a giant pickle and was called an F350. It was so big that when little kids saw it, they would point and say "WOW! Look at that huge truck!"

## Talking on the Computer

One day, Ryan was using his computer when he met a wonderful lady named Julie. They would send each other happy messages every day. Julie loved to tell funny stories, and Ryan loved to listen to them. They laughed together through their computers!

After talking for many days, they decided to meet at a special place called Chipotle. It's a restaurant where they make yummy burritos wrapped up like little blankets with rice and beans inside.

## The Big Day

On a bright, sunny day, Ryan walked into Chipotle. He was a little nervous but very excited! There was Julie with the biggest, happiest smile. They sat down together and started talking about their favorite foods and sharing silly jokes.

They talked and talked and laughed so much that their cheeks hurt from smiling! They forgot all about time because they were having so much fun together.

## Walking by the Pretty Lake

When the Chipotle workers said "Time to close!" Ryan and Julie didn't want to stop talking. So they decided to take a walk around a beautiful lake nearby.

The lake was magical! There were fluffy ducks swimming around going "quack, quack!" and pretty birds singing songs in the trees. The water sparkled like diamonds when the sun touched it. Ryan and Julie walked slowly, talking about all their favorite things.

## Ryan the Helper

When it was time to say goodbye, Ryan looked at Julie's car and noticed something. "Oh my!" he said. "Your tire looks sleepy - it needs more air to wake up!"

Julie was worried, but Ryan smiled his biggest smile. "Don't worry! I love helping people, and I'm really good at fixing things!"

Ryan ran to his giant green truck and pulled out a special machine called a compressor. It makes a funny "whoosh" sound and fills tires with air, just like blowing up a balloon! 

Ryan filled up the sleepy tire until it was happy and full again. Then he filled all the other tires too, just to make sure they were all ready for safe driving. Julie clapped her hands and danced a little dance. "Thank you, Ryan! You're the most helpful person ever!"

## More Fixing

Then Ryan noticed something else about Julie's car. There was a special plug that wasn't working right - the kind that helps charge things up with electricity.

"I can fix that for you another day," Ryan said with a wink. "I love fixing things and making them work perfectly again!"

## A Happy Ending

Julie gave Ryan the biggest, warmest hug. "You have the kindest heart!" she said. And Ryan felt so happy and warm inside, like drinking hot chocolate on a cold day.

From that magical day on, Ryan and Julie became the very best of friends. They went on many more adventures together, and eventually, they loved each other so much that they decided to have a family.

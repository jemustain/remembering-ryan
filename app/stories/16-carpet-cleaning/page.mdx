# Carpet Cleaning

## A Messy Problem

Once upon a time, Julie, the best friend of Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, looked at her house and said, "Oh no! My carpets are so dirty!" Her dog Ryu and her two cats, one orange and one black and white, loved to run and play, leaving muddy paw prints and fur everywhere. Julie tried to clean the carpets with a broom and a scrub brush, but it was hard work, and the carpets still looked messy.

## Ryan's Super Solution

Ryan came over with his dog Balto and saw Julie scrubbing. "Don't worry, Julie!" he said. "I know how to make those carpets clean!" He drove his big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant, to the store and got a special machine called a wet vac. It was like a superhero vacuum that could suck up dirt and make carpets shiny!

Back at Julie's house, Ryan got to work. The wet vac went whoosh-whoosh, spraying water and sucking up all the dirt. Julie clapped as the carpets turned bright and clean again. "You're amazing, Ryan!" she said. Balto and Ryu watched, wagging their tails, while the cats sat on the couch, twitching their whiskers. The whole house smelled fresh, like flowers and sunshine.

## Clean and Cozy

Ryan cleaned every room, even the corners where Ryu liked to hide his toys. When he was done, the carpets looked brand new! Julie gave Ryan a big high-five. "This is the cleanest house ever!" she cheered.

But with Ryu, Balto, and the cats running around, it wasn't long before the carpets got dirty again. Ryu tracked in mud from the yard, Balto rolled on the floor with a squeaky toy, and the cats left little bits of fur. Julie laughed and said, "Our animals keep us busy!" Ryan grinned. "We'll clean it again together!"

They sat on the porch, petting Balto, Ryu, and the cats, who purred happily. The house was full of love, even if the carpets were a little messy. Ryan and Julie knew their furry friends made every day a happy adventure.

*Sometimes the best homes are the ones that are lived in and loved, even if they need a little cleaning now and then.*

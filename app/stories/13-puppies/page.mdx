# Puppies

Once upon a time, Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, got a call from his old roommate, Tim. Tim's dog had a litter of fluffy puppies, and he needed help finding them new homes. "Ryan, you're so good with animals!" Tim said. "Can you help?" Ryan said, "Of course!" and drove his big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant, to pick up the puppies.uppies

Once upon a time, Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder, got a call from his old roommate, Tim. Tim’s dog had a litter of fluffy puppies, and he needed help finding them new homes. “Ryan, you’re so good with animals!” Tim said. “Can you help?” Ryan said, “Of course!” and drove his big green truck, an F350 as big as a friendly giant, to pick up the puppies.
There were five wiggly, cuddly puppies with soft fur and big eyes. Ryan brought them to Julie’s house, where Julie, her dog Ryu, and her two cats were excited to meet them. “Oh, they’re so cute!” Julie said, petting their tiny heads. Ryu sniffed the puppies, and the cats watched from the couch, twitching their tails.
Ryan and Julie made a plan to find loving homes for the puppies. They put up signs and talked to nice people who wanted a furry friend. Ryan met lots of families, kids, and grown-ups who came to see the puppies. One family took a puppy who loved to chase balls. Another took a puppy who liked to cuddle. Soon, four puppies had happy homes!
But one little puppy, a mischievous one with floppy ears, was harder to place. Nobody seemed just right for him. Ryan named him Chewy because he loved to nibble on everything! Ryan decided to keep Chewy with him in his big green truck while he worked. Chewy rode along, wagging his tail and looking out the window.
One day, Ryan found Chewy chewing on his favorite hammer handle in the truck! “Oh, Chewy!” Ryan laughed. “You’re a silly puppy!” He gave Chewy a toy to chew instead, and they became the best of buddies. For weeks, Chewy stayed with Ryan, sleeping in a cozy blanket in the truck and playing with Balto, Ryan’s dog, at Julie’s house.
Finally, Ryan and Julie found the perfect home for Chewy with a kind family who had a big yard. Chewy ran to them, wagging his tail, ready for new adventures. Julie hugged Ryan. “You’re so good at finding homes for puppies!” she said. Ryan smiled, happy to help.
Balto, Ryu, and the cats were glad to have their house back, but they missed Chewy’s playful barks. Ryan and Julie sat together, petting their animals, feeling warm and happy, knowing all the puppies had loving homes.

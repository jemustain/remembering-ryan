# Gone for the Weekend

Once upon a time, Ryan and Julie were making plans for a special weekend. Julie had the wonderful opportunity to visit her friends and family who lived far away, and she was excited to see them and share all her happy news about their baby on the way!

But Julie had some important friends at home who needed someone special to take care of them while she was gone - her beloved dog Ryu and her two precious cats, the orange one who loved to stretch in sunny spots and the black-and-white one who was always ready for cuddles.

Julie looked a little worried as she thought about leaving her furry family. But Ryan, with his kind heart and caring nature, immediately said, "Don't worry at all! I would love to help! I'll take the very best care of Ryu and your cats, and Balto can help me too!"

On Friday morning, when the sun was just beginning to paint the sky with golden light, Ryan drove Julie to the airport in his big green truck.

 Balto sat proudly in the back seat, his tail wagging with excitement because he loved going on adventures with Ryan.

At the airport, Julie gave Ryan the longest, warmest hug, holding him close. "I'm going to miss you so much!" she said, her voice full of love and just a tiny bit of sadness.

Ryan hugged her back just as tightly and said with his sweetest smile, "I'll miss you too, but don't worry! Ryu and the cats will keep me wonderful company, and we'll have lots of fun together!"

Julie waved goodbye as she walked into the busy airport, her colorful suitcase rolling behind her on its little wheels. Ryan and Balto watched until she disappeared through the doors, both of them already looking forward to her return.

Every single day while Julie was away, Ryan made sure to visit her house and take the very best care of all her beloved pets.

 It became like the most important job he had ever had!

He would fill Ryu's bowl with the most delicious, nutritious dog food and watch as Ryu gobbled it up with happy tail wags. Then Ryan and Balto would take Ryu for long, adventurous walks by the sparkly lake where they had gone on their very first date together.

Ryu was delighted to have Ryan and Balto as his special companions! He would wag his tail so enthusiastically and run in joyful circles around the yard, playing chase and fetch until all three dogs were happily tired.

For Julie's cats, Ryan made sure they had their favorite treats - the crunchy ones that made little *munch, munch* sounds when they ate them. He would gently pet their soft fur while they purred like tiny, contented motors.

The orange cat would stretch out in the warmest sunny spot and purr so loudly you could hear it from across the room. The black-and-white cat would rub against Ryan's legs like a furry scarf, showing how much she appreciated his gentle care.

"You're all so sweet and wonderful!" Ryan would say, laughing as the animals surrounded him with their love and affection.

Meanwhile, far away in another city, Julie was having the most wonderful time with her friends and family. She shared stories about her exciting life, told them all about the precious baby on the way, and couldn't help but talk about Ryan constantly.

"He fixed my car when we first met," she would say with sparkling eyes. "He built the most beautiful fire in my wood stove, and he's the kindest, most caring person you could ever imagine. He's the best!"

Julie's friends and family could see how much she loved Ryan just by the way her whole face lit up when she talked about him. But even though she was having such a wonderful time, she found herself missing Ryan, Balto, Ryu, and her cats more and more with each passing hour.

Back at home, Ryan was thinking about Julie just as much as she was thinking about him. Every evening, after he had taken perfect care of all the animals, he would step outside and look up at the twinkling stars in the dark sky.

"I can't wait for Julie to come back home!" he would say to Balto, who would bark his agreement - "Woof!" - which meant "Me too, Ryan!"

Ryan knew that somewhere far away, Julie might be looking at those same stars and thinking about him too. The thought made his heart feel warm and connected to her, even across all those miles.

On Sunday, the most wonderful day of the weekend, Ryan and Balto drove back to the airport to welcome Julie home. Ryan's heart was beating with excitement, and Balto's tail was wagging so fast it was just a furry blur!

When Julie walked out of the airport and saw them waiting for her, her face broke into the biggest, most joyful smile. She ran over as fast as she could and gave Ryan the most enormous, loving hug you could imagine.

"I'm back!" she cheered, her voice full of happiness and relief.

Balto was so excited to see Julie again that he wagged his tail so hard it looked like a fuzzy helicopter propeller trying to take off! Julie knelt down and gave him the best welcome-home pets, saying, "Thank you so much for helping Ryan take such wonderful care of Ryu and my cats!"

In the truck on the way back to their cozy home, Julie told Ryan all about her wonderful weekend - the friends she had seen, the family members who were excited about the baby, and especially how she had talked about Ryan to everyone she met.

"I told them all about how amazing you are," Julie said, making Ryan blush the sweetest shade of pink. "Everyone can't wait to meet you!"

Ryan smiled the happiest smile and said, "I'm so incredibly happy you're home safe. I missed you every single moment you were gone."

As they drove through their familiar neighborhood, their hearts felt as warm and cozy as being wrapped in the softest blanket on a chilly day. They were together again, and they knew that Balto, Ryu, and the cats were all waiting at home, ready to celebrate their happy reunion as one complete, loving family.

*Missing someone you love makes coming home to them feel like the most wonderful celebration in the world.*

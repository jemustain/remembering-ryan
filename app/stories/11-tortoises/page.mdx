# Tortoises

## Ryan's Special Friends Move In

Once upon a time, when Ryan moved into Julie's cozy house to get ready for their precious baby, he brought along his big green truck - his F350 as big and friendly as a gentle giant - and his beloved dog Balto. But that wasn't all! Ryan had some very special friends that he wanted Julie to meet.

Ryan carefully carried in four little tortoises with the most beautiful hard shells that shined like polished stones! These weren't just any ordinary tortoises - each one had their own special personality and their own wonderful name.

There was Tiny, who was the smallest but had the biggest appetite for crunchy lettuce. Speedy was always the first to explore new places (even though tortoises move quite slowly!). Sunny had the brightest, most cheerful shell that looked like it was kissed by sunshine. And Star had the most beautiful patterns on her shell that looked like tiny constellations in the night sky.

## Meeting the New Family Members

Julie, her dog Ryu, and her two cats - the orange one and the black-and-white one - were absolutely thrilled to meet Ryan's special tortoise friends! They gathered around to watch the tortoises slowly walk around, munching on their favorite crunchy vegetables with tiny *crunch, crunch* sounds.

But Ryan looked around the house and realized something important. "These little friends need a perfect, cozy home where they'll be safe and happy!" he said thoughtfully.

Ryan knew exactly what he needed to do. He would build the most amazing tortoise house anyone had ever seen! It would be safe, comfortable, and beautiful - just like the home he and Julie were creating for their growing family.

## The Big Building Project

Ryan rolled up his sleeves and headed to the garage with all his special building tools. This was going to be his most important project yet!

He gathered strong, sturdy wood that would make the walls safe and secure. He also got clear plexiglass that would let everyone see the tortoises and let lots of light shine in for them to enjoy.

Ryan worked with the careful precision of a master builder. He measured everything perfectly with his ruler, counting out loud, "One, two, three inches! This needs to be exactly right for my tortoise friends!"

*Zzzzt, zzzzt!* went his saw as he carefully cut each piece of wood to the perfect size. Then he used his sandpaper to make every surface smooth and soft, so the tortoises would never get hurt on any rough edges.

## Working Under the Stars

Ryan was so dedicated to making the perfect home that he often worked late into the evening. When the stars began twinkling in the dark sky like tiny diamonds, Ryan would still be in the garage, carefully staining the wood to make it shiny and beautiful.

He would work and work, sometimes until the moon was high in the sky, casting silvery light through the garage windows. Ryan wanted everything to be absolutely perfect for Tiny, Speedy, Sunny, and Star.

## Love and Support

Every night, Julie would peek into the garage and bring Ryan a delicious snack and something warm to drink. "You're making such an amazing home for them!" she would say with the proudest smile, watching Ryan work with such care and love.

Balto and Ryu would wag their tails enthusiastically, as if they were cheering Ryan on in his important work. The cats would sit in the doorway, their curious eyes watching every hammer tap and every careful measurement, purring softly as if they approved of the wonderful project.

## The Perfect Tortoise Palace

After many weeks of careful, loving work, the tortoise house was finally complete! It was absolutely magnificent - big enough for all four tortoises to walk around comfortably, strong enough to keep them perfectly safe, and with clear walls so that everyone in the family could watch Tiny, Speedy, Sunny, and Star as they went about their daily tortoise adventures.

Ryan carefully put soft, comfortable dirt inside for them to walk on, along with smooth rocks for them to climb over and explore. He even installed a little water dish where they could splash and drink whenever they felt thirsty.

When Ryan gently placed each tortoise into their new home, they wiggled their little legs with what seemed like pure happiness! They immediately began exploring every corner of their beautiful new palace, stretching their necks out to see everything around them.

## A Happy Family Gathering

That evening, Ryan and Julie sat together by the amazing tortoise house, watching their little shelled friends explore and settle into their new home. It was the most peaceful, wonderful sight!

Balto came over and gently sniffed the outside of the tortoise house, his tail wagging with friendly curiosity. Ryu tilted his head this way and that way, trying to figure out these interesting new family members who moved so slowly and had houses on their backs!

The cats sat nearby, purring their approval like tiny, contented motors, occasionally reaching out a careful paw to gently touch the clear walls of the tortoise house.

"You made it absolutely perfect!" Julie said, giving Ryan the biggest, warmest hug. "Tiny, Speedy, Sunny, and Star are the luckiest tortoises in the whole world!"

Ryan smiled, his heart feeling as warm as a sunny summer day. He felt so proud that he had created a safe, beautiful home for his special friends.

## A House Full of Love

As they sat together surrounded by all their beloved animals, Ryan and Julie looked around their home with hearts full of joy. Their house was now full of so much love - Balto with his loyal, happy spirit, Ryu with his playful energy, the two cats with their gentle purring, the four tortoises with their quiet, peaceful presence, and most wonderfully of all, a precious baby on the way.

Ryan and Julie knew they were building something truly special - not just a tortoise house, but a happy, loving home where every member of their growing family would feel safe, loved, and perfectly cared for.

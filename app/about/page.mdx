# About This Website

## Purpose

This website was created as a loving memorial to **Ryan William Alf** (October 10, 1985 - April 28, 2022) and as a special gift for his young son.

The site serves two main purposes:

1. **Memorial**: To honor Ryan's memory and provide a place where family and friends can remember and celebrate his life
2. **Stories for Ryan's Son**: To create a collection of age-appropriate stories that help Ryan's son learn about Ryan as he grows up

## Why Stories?

We chose to tell Ryan's story through children's book-style narratives because:

- They're easy for a young child to understand and enjoy
- They focus on the positive, loving aspects of Ryan's life
- They can be read aloud as bedtime stories
- They help create an emotional connection between Ryan and his son
- They can grow with the child as he gets older

## How This Site Works

### For Young Readers
- Stories are written in simple, age-appropriate language
- Each story focuses on a positive aspect of Ryan's life
- Stories refer to Ryan by name to help with understanding
- Content is designed to be read aloud or independently

### For Family and Friends
- The memorial section provides a place to share photos and memories
- Stories can be added over time to mark special occasions
- The site preserves Ryan's memory for future generations

## Technical Details

This website is built using:
- **Next.js**: For fast, modern web functionality
- **MDX**: For easy markdown-based content creation
- **Tailwind CSS**: For beautiful, child-friendly styling
- **GitHub**: For source code management
- **Vercel**: For hosting and deployment

All stories are written in simple markdown files, making it easy to add new content over time.

## Contributing

### Adding Stories
New stories can be added by creating markdown files in the `/stories` folder. Each story should:
- Be age-appropriate for a young child
- Focus on positive memories and characteristics
- Use simple, clear language
- Include Ryan's name rather than family terms

### Sharing Memories
If you'd like to contribute to the memorial section or share photos, please contact the family.

- Honors Ryan's life appropriately

- Respects the privacy of family members
- Creates a positive, loving narrative

# Story Style Guide
*Guidelines for writing stories about Ryan for his son*

## Writing Philosophy

These stories are written for Ryan's young son to help him understand and remember his father. Each story should be:
- **Age-appropriate** for a 3-year-old (simple language, concrete concepts)
- **Positive and comforting** (focus on Ryan's love, kindness, and good qualities)
- **Emotionally safe** (avoid scary or confusing elements)
- **Respectful of family** (honor Julie and Ryan's relationship)

## Language Guidelines

### Tone & Voice
- **Warm and gentle** - like a loving family member telling a story
- **Simple and clear** - use vocabulary a 3-year-old can understand
- **Natural and conversational** - avoid overly cute or fluffy language
- **Consistent** - maintain the same storytelling voice across all stories

### Language to Avoid
❌ **Overly fluffy adjectives:**
- "special place called" → just name the place
- "sleepy tire" → "flat tire" or "tire that needed air"
- "fluffy ducks" → "ducks"
- "magical lake" → "lake" or "beautiful lake"
- "cozy house" (overused) → "house" or "home"
- "precious baby" → "baby"

✅ **Use natural, simple language:**
- "They went to Chipotle" (not "a special place called Chipotle")
- "The tire was flat" (not "the tire looked sleepy")
- "Ducks were swimming" (not "fluffy ducks were paddling around")

### Name Usage
- Always refer to "Ryan" by name (never "Daddy" or "your father")
- Refer to "Julie" by name (the context makes the relationship clear)
- Use "Mommy" when the child is speaking or thinking about Julie

### Sentence Structure
- **Short, simple sentences** when possible
- **Active voice** (Ryan did something, rather than something was done)
- **Present tense for ongoing truths** ("Ryan loved animals")
- **Past tense for specific events** ("Ryan fixed the car")

### Descriptive Language
- **Be specific but not excessive**: "green truck" not "big, beautiful, shiny green truck"
- **Use concrete terms**: "tire needed air" not "sleepy tire"
- **Avoid repetitive cute phrases**: Don't call everything "special" or "magical"
- **Let actions show character**: Show Ryan being helpful rather than saying he's "the most helpful person ever"

## Character Descriptions

### Ryan
**Standard Description**: "Ryan, the tall, blonde, hard-working builder"
- Emphasize: kindness, helpfulness, building/fixing skills, love for animals
- Physical traits: tall, blonde hair
- Personality: gentle, caring, hardworking, skilled with his hands

### Julie 
**Standard Description**: "Julie, Ryan's best friend" or "Julie"
- Emphasize: intelligence, kindness, love for animals
- Relationship: Ryan's partner and best friend

### Animals
- **Balto**: Ryan's loyal dog
- **Ryu**: Julie's dog
- **Two cats**: one orange, one black and white (Julie's cats)
- **Four tortoises**: Ryan's pet tortoises

## Specific Content Guidelines

### Vehicle References
❌ **AVOID these descriptions:**
- "giant pickle" (too silly/inappropriate)
- "friendly giant" (confusing metaphor)
- "gentle giant" (confusing metaphor)

✅ **USE these instead:**
- "his big green truck"
- "his F350 truck"
- "Ryan's big, strong truck"
- "the large green truck"

### Descriptive Elements
- Use specific, concrete details kids can visualize
- Include sensory details (sounds, colors, textures)
- Avoid abstract concepts or complex emotions

### Story Structure
Each story should follow this pattern:
1. **Opening**: "Once upon a time..." (establishes fairy-tale comfort)
2. **Setting**: Where and when the story takes place
3. **Problem/Situation**: What happened that needed Ryan's help
4. **Ryan's Solution**: How Ryan's skills and kindness solved the problem
5. **Happy Ending**: How everyone felt better afterward
6. **Moral/Message**: What this shows about Ryan's character

## Family Content Guidelines

### Appropriate Topics
- Ryan's helpfulness and problem-solving
- His love for animals
- Building and fixing things
- Daily life adventures
- Relationship milestones (appropriate for age)
- Holiday celebrations
- Learning moments

### Handle Carefully
- Pregnancy/baby topics (keep simple and positive)
- Medical situations (focus on care and love, not scary details)
- Challenges (show how Ryan overcame them with love)

### Avoid Completely
- Adult relationship complexities
- Financial stress
- Serious medical details
- Anything that might cause anxiety

## Writing Examples

### Good Example:
> "Ryan looked at Julie's car and saw that the tire needed air. 'I can fix that!' he said. Ryan got his air pump from his truck and filled the tire until it was round again."

### Why This Works:
- Simple, clear action
- Shows Ryan's helpfulness through actions
- Natural language
- No excessive adjectives

### Poor Example:
> "Ryan looked at Julie's precious car and noticed that one very sleepy tire needed some magical air to wake up from its tired slumber."

### Why This Doesn't Work:
- Overly cute language
- Confusing metaphors ("sleepy tire")
- Too many unnecessary adjectives
- Could confuse a young child

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any story, ask:
- [ ] Could a 3-year-old understand this?
- [ ] Does this make Ryan look loving and capable?
- [ ] Is the language warm and gentle?
- [ ] Are there any confusing metaphors or references?
- [ ] Does this end on a positive, comforting note?
- [ ] Would this help a child feel closer to Ryan?

## Revision Notes

When updating existing stories:
- Replace inappropriate metaphors (like "giant pickle")
- Simplify overly complex sentences
- Ensure consistent character descriptions
- Add sensory details where helpful
- Maintain the warm, loving tone throughout

*Remember: These stories are precious gifts to help Ryan's son know his father. Every word should be chosen with love and care.*
